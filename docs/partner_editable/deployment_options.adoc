This Quick Start provides three deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a complete MongoDB Atlas environment within AWS consisting of the a project, cluster, and more.

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC*. This option peers {partner-product-short-name} with a new VPC.

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC*. This option peers {partner-product-short-name} with your existing VPC.

For secure connections to your MongoDB Atlas Cluster, each option provisions an AWS IAM role and corresponding MongoDB database user.

This Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure database cluster tier settings and other {partner-product-short-name} settings, as discussed later in this guide.
