The Quick Start provides 3 deployment options: 

1. Atlas deployment + peering with new AWS VPC
2. Atlas deployment + peering with existing AWS VPC
3. Atlas deployment - without peering


Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following _{partner-product-short-name}_ environment in the
AWS Cloud. You application fills in the missing piece.

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
  ** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* A highly available architecture for MongoDB Atlas cluster that spans at least three Availability Zones.
* Deployment of MongoDB Atlas project, database user, cluster, and project IP access list using MongoDB CloudFormation resource types.
* VPC peering between your VPC and the new Atlas Deployment.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.

The simplest deployment option, Atlas deployment without peering skips the creation of any VPC resources and
creates only MongoDB Atlas resources using MongoDB CloudFormation resource types.
