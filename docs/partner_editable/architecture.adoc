This Quick Start provides three deployment options: 

. Atlas deployment and peering in a new AWS VPC
. Atlas deployment and peering in an existing AWS VPC
. Atlas deployment without peering

Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following _{partner-product-short-name}_ environment in the
AWS Cloud.

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* A highly available architecture for MongoDB Atlas cluster that spans at least three Availability Zones.
* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* MongoDB Atlas project, database user, cluster, and project IP access list using MongoDB CloudFormation resource types.
* VPC peering between your VPC and the Atlas deployment.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.

Deploying Atlas without peering is the simplest deployment option. It skips the creation of any VPC resources and creates only MongoDB Atlas resources using MongoDB CloudFormation resource types.
